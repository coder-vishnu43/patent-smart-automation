PROTEIN-PEG INTERACTIONS THAT REDIRECT THE THERMAL UNFOLDING PATHWAY OF PEGYLATED HUMAN GALECTIN-3C,biotech,2024,UNIV FLORIDA,"Conjugation of polymers to proteins, including biomedically-relevant PEGylation, is a promising approach to address a central challenge of biologics and biotech: the lack of protein stability in demanding non-native environments. Application of conjugation is hindered by the lack of atomic level understanding of protein-polymerinteractions, preventing design of conjugates with predicted properties. An integrative structural and biophysical approach was used to address this challenge using a polymer-modified carbohydrate recognition domain of human galectin-3 (Gal3C), a lectin essential for cellular adhesion and potential biologic. Modification with PEG and other polymers dramatically increased Gal3C thermal stability and redirected its unfolding pathway through forming a stable intermediate. Distinct polymer properties which increased protein thermal stability were revealed. Structural details of Gal3C-polymer conjugates revealed by NMR pointed to the important role of polymer localization. Residues local to the site of conjugation were perturbed by polymer conjugation and these perturbations remained localized over a wide temperature range. For PEGylated conjugates, replacing key lysine residues within the PEG-perturbed region altered the protein-PEG interface and thermal unfolding behavior, providing mechanistic insight into rational design of conjugates that will expand the benefits of polymer conjugation.",7

The robot hand (6a) has a force sensor (20). The control part presses a part of the robot hand (6a) against the object (3), and controls the operation of the robot arm (6c) so that positional information and attitude information of the object (3) are detected by the force sensor (20).SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 3",4
"Head of robot, head assembly of robot and robot",robotics,2023,"MIDEA GROUP SHANGHAI CO LTD,,MIDEA GROUP CO LTD","The invention relates to the technical field of robots, and provides a robot head, a robot head assembly and a robot. The head of the robot comprises a head main skeleton which comprises a first skeleton and a second skeleton and forms an assembly space of a neck joint; the first cover body and the first framework form a first accommodating space; the second cover body and the second framework form a second accommodating space; and the projection unit is positioned in the first accommodating space or the second accommodating space. According to the head of the robot, the assembly space, the first containing space and the second containing space can be used for installation of different parts of the robot respectively, the projection unit is installed in the containing space between the head main framework and the cover body, and it can be guaranteed that the projection unit has enough installation space and heat dissipation space; and the projection unit is ensured to have a relatively good use environment. In addition, the position of the projection unit can be adjusted along with pitching or rotation of the head so as to meet different projection requirements.",1
"Robot, robot system, and robot operation method",robotics,2025,KAWASAKI HEAVY IND LTD,A robot (6) is provided with: a robot hand (6a) attached to the tip of a robot arm (6c); and a control unit that controls the operation of each of the robot arm (6c) and the robot hand (6a) so as to perform work on the object (3). The robot hand (6a) has a force sensor (20). The control unit controls the operation of the robot arm (6c) such that position information and orientation information of the object (3) are detected by the force sensor (20) by pressing a part of the robot hand (6a) against the object (3).,3
"ROBOT, ROBOT SYSTEM, AND ROBOT CONTROL METHOD",robotics,2021,SEIKO EPSON CORP,"To reduce loss of power due to turning on and off of a switch in a robot.SOLUTION: The robot includes: a power conversion unit having a switch for converting DC power supplied from a battery to AC power by opening and closing of the switch and outputting the AC power; a manipulator unit driven by the AC power supplied from the power conversion unit; and a control unit for controlling the supply of the AC power from the power conversion unit to the manipulator unit. The power conversion unit has an operation mode including a first mode for supplying the AC power to the manipulator unit with predetermined voltage and frequency, and a second mode for supplying the AC power to the manipulator unit with voltage and frequency, either of which is smaller than the voltage and frequency in the first mode. The control unit switches the mode between the first mode and the second mode.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 4",5
"Robot, robot system, and robot operation method",robotics,2025,KAWASAKI HEAVY IND LTD,"A robot is provided with: a robot hand (7a) attached to the tip of a robot arm (7c); and a control unit that controls the operation of each of the robot arm (7c) and the robot hand (7a) so as to perform work on the object. A robot hand (7a) has a tool (25) for attaching and detaching a fastener (8) to and from an object, and a force sensor (20A). The control unit moves the tool (25) from a phase in which the fastener (8) cannot be attached to and detached from the object to a phase in which the fastener (8) can be attached to and detached from the object on the basis of the sensor output of the force sensor (20A) while applying a pressing force to the fastener (8) supported by the object by the tool (25).",9
