When recalling information with many prorogations a dynamically fluid field is developed around the item of interest. Using current/signal information is passed through a set of “slits” a photon is used to control the sensors holding the category of information. When the sensor controlling the current gets the input to output is the electron and it will go through the “slits” the as determined by a input that is given to the laser controlling the photon. After this the electron/signal will get detected by a sensor and activate the information source inside.

A sound collector is introduced into a school lecture room. Voiceprints of the school children and the teachers are registered in advance, and minutes of utterances are created by voice recognition.

The accuracy of the analogical reasoning of the artificial intelligence is enhanced, and made to further approximate an expert determination which is performed by the teacher, and a genus evaluation method depending on a teacher individual is changed to a standardized and equal evaluation method.
