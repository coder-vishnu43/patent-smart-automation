An obstacle avoidance motion optimization routine receives a planned path and obstacle detection data as inputs, and computes a commanded robot path which avoids any detected obstacles. Robot joint motions to follow the tool center point path are used by a robot controller to command robot motion. The planning and optimization calculations are performed in a feedback loop which is decoupled from the controller feedback loop which computes robot commands based on actual robot position. The two feedback loops perform planning, command and control calculations in real time, including responding to dynamic obstacles which may be present in the robot workspace.

The technique uses both robot-obstacle distance and relative velocity to determine when to apply velocity attenuation, and computes a joint speed limit vector based on a robot-obstacle distance, a maximum obstacle speed, and a computed stopping time as a function of the joint speed.

A proxy service associates a robot of a robot fleet to each task and adaptation instructions to define how to adapt the robot fleet to perform the tasks. A workflow system generates a workflow defining a performance order of the tasks. A simulation system applies the workflow in an environment that includes digital models of the robot fleet and the tasks.

The instrument guide may guide a percutaneously insertable instrument along an insertion axis. The instrument guide may also be positioned on an electromagnetic (EM) field generator, where the EM field generator can generate an EM field. A first robotic arm may be coupled to the EM field generator and it may move the EM field generator and the instrument guide. The system then determines: an EM target positioned within a patient, and a registration that maps positions within an EM coordinate frame associated with the EM field to positions within a robotic coordinate frame. The system may also determine, based on the registration, a position of the EM target within the robotic coordinate frame. Based on the position of the EM target within the robotic coordinate frame, move the first robotic arm may move to align the insertion axis of the instrument guide with the EM target.",AURIS HEALTH INC,SRAMEK CHRISTOPHER;;AYVALI ELIF;;BERMAN DAVID BURDICK,AURIS HEALTH INC (2022-09-17),https://lens.org/018-424-637-593-652,Patent Application,yes,2,0,17,162-200-939-297-910;;192-372-668-089-616;;044-922-219-821-610;;060-618-282-947-746;;012-363-098-866-417;;056-525-431-603-158;;083-823-068-690-019;;016-392-491-486-785;;046-484-354-722-477;;096-087-160-017-037;;018-424-637-593-652;;041-453-844-933-556;;167-383-056-384-38X;;105-738-344-158-695;;152-195-667-809-241;;040-557-211-640-876;;097-425-571-523-132,KR;;JP;;EP;;WO;;US,18,162-200-939-297-910;;192-372-668-089-616;;044-922-219-821-610;;012-363-098-866-417;;060-618-282-947-746;;056-525-431-603-158;;083-823-068-690-019;;016-392-491-486-785;;046-484-354-722-477;;096-087-160-017-037;;018-424-637-593-652;;041-453-844-933-556;;167-383-056-384-38X;;105-738-344-158-695;;097-425-571-523-132;;063-527-564-166-353;;040-557-211-640-876;;152-195-667-809-241,KR;;JP;;EP;;CN;;WO;;US,0,B25J9/1689;;G05B2219/45118;;B25J9/0087;;B25J5/007;;A61B34/30;;A61B34/20;;A61B2034/2051;;A61B2090/378;;A61B2090/571;;A61B2034/107;;A61B2090/397;;A61B2034/2059;;A61B2034/2061;;A61B2090/306;;A61B2090/309;;A61B2017/00725;;A61B2090/376;;A61B34/30;;A61B34/20;;B25J9/0087;;B25J9/1689;;A61B2034/2051;;A61B2017/00725;;A61B34/20;;A61B34/30;;A61B2034/302;;A61B2034/301;;A61B2034/2051;;A61B34/37;;A61B34/70;;A61B34/32;;B25J9/1653;;B25J9/1664;;B25J19/027,A61B34/20;;A61B34/30,,1,1,072-310-456-382-349,10.1109/tmi.2013.2259636;;23911947,"T.
