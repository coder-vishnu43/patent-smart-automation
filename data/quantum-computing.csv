The methods are suitable for implementation using a hybrid classical-quantum computation system.

Described is a quantum computational method that involves a cumulant expansion of expectation values calculated for each of a set of moments of an operator. This reduces the need for a large overhead in the number of measurements and instead measures the expectation value of the moments with one set of measurement circuits.

The ion trap may have electrodes for shuttling and/or gate operations (fig 5). The ion trap may be used in a quantum CCD computer (fig 1).",UNIVERSAL QUANTUM LTD;;UNIV OF SUSSEX,ZAK DAVID ROMASZKO;;IAIN MCINTOSH HUNTER;;HAROLD GODWIN,,https://lens.org/003-327-206-192-014,Patent Application,no,1,0,10,061-708-229-748-014;;051-763-301-159-88X;;046-462-955-553-077;;186-379-568-768-157;;130-514-708-183-597;;107-075-341-372-07X;;057-507-209-040-769;;072-221-275-353-683;;003-327-206-192-014;;030-335-596-329-838,JP;;AU;;EP;;CN;;WO;;US;;GB,10,061-708-229-748-014;;051-763-301-159-88X;;046-462-955-553-077;;186-379-568-768-157;;130-514-708-183-597;;107-075-341-372-07X;;057-507-209-040-769;;030-335-596-329-838;;072-221-275-353-683;;003-327-206-192-014,JP;;AU;;EP;;CN;;WO;;US;;GB,0,H03M1/004;;H03M1/66;;G06N10/40;;G06N10/40;;G06N10/40;;H03M1/66;;G06F1/04;;G06N10/20;;G06F1/08,G06N10/00;;G06N10/40,,2,2,012-090-965-645-399;;047-497-222-129-638,10.1116/1.5126186;;10.1103/physrevapplied.11.024010,"Kaushal V et al, ""Shuttling-based trapped-ion quantum information processing"" AVS Quantum Science 2.1 (2020), 014101;;Stuart J et al, ""Chip-integrated voltage sources for control of trapped ions"", Physical Review Applied 11.2 (2019), 024010",PENDING

After each instruction block, the quantum computing system performs a fault-tolerant syndrome measurement of stabilizers on the n physical qubits using the first ancilla and a second ancilla respectively. After all instruction blocks of the plurality of instruction blocks have been applied to the n physical qubits, the quantum computing system performs a fault-tolerant state measurement, using the first and second ancilla, of each logical operator of formula (I) by measuring the n physical qubits. During any of the fault-tolerant steps of performing initialisation, syndrome measurement or state measurement, we discard the computer results and restart the computation of the quantum operation if any measurement of the first or second ancilla indicates a fault.",QUANTINUUM LTD,AMARO FERNANDEZ DAVID;;SELF CHRISTOPHER;;BENEDETTI MARCELLO;;YAMAMOTO KENTARO,,https://lens.org/112-269-604-258-073,Patent Application,yes,1,2,1,112-269-604-258-073,WO,8,100-608-396-715-900;;045-490-461-650-071;;067-676-964-217-492;;004-394-561-248-904;;112-269-604-258-073;;040-282-576-594-235;;004-874-453-643-731;;190-398-390-563-485,EP;;WO;;GB,0,G06N10/70;;G06N10/40,G06N10/70;;G06N10/40,,46,32,082-910-417-172-586;;050-008-282-468-525;;042-560-609-977-639;;066-129-271-213-035;;001-171-952-487-788;;122-666-175-857-095;;061-577-746-765-94X;;177-421-225-246-832;;111-748-118-753-855;;192-234-653-366-89X;;075-884-007-973-962;;099-081-729-774-414;;035-762-388-486-546;;061-136-435-467-044;;028-570-025-108-984;;049-636-414-051-724;;015-267-734-157-056;;066-894-633-878-762;;012-289-961-363-800;;078-913-062-521-992;;106-055-775-585-342;;035-724-970-161-563;;131-045-608-027-738;;086-990-244-244-737;;053-788-199-187-684;;012-925-521-857-967;;001-411-127-800-359;;186-992-743-702-100;;018-668-428-628-629;;092-217-088-565-983;;002-092-744-068-301;;118-757-094-812-193,10.1038/s41534-020-00319-5;;10.1103/prxquantum.1.010302;;10.1088/1367-2630/15/12/123012;;10.1038/nature23458;;28905912;;19905613;;10.1103/physrevlett.103.150502;;10.1109/sfcs.1994.365700;;10.22331/q-2021-04-15-433;;10.3389/fddsv.2022.908870;;10.1038/s41586-021-03588-y;;34262210;;pmc8279951;;36813892;;pmc9946823;;10.1038/s41586-022-05434-1;;35614250;;10.1038/s41586-022-04721-1;;10.1103/prxquantum.3.010345;;10.1038/nphys2275;;10.1038/s41534-017-0018-2;;10.1103/physreva.102.022427;;10.1063/1.5088164;;10.1142/s0219749904000079;;10.1103/physrevlett.82.1835;;33828318;;10.1038/s41586-021-03318-4;;10.1126/sciadv.1701074;;29062889;;pmc5650489;;10.1103/physrevlett.129.150502;;36269974;;10.1103/physrevlett.121.050502;;30118291;;10.1038/s41567-021-01409-7;;10.22331/q-2022-05-09-707;;10.1109/qce49297.2020.00049;;10.1145/3544563;;32908267;;10.1038/s41586-020-2667-0;;10.1088/2058-9565/ac3e54;;10.1088/2058-9565/ab4eb5;;10.1088/1367-2630/abf1b3;;10.1088/2058-9565/ab8e92;;10.1038/s41567-023-02282-2,"RUI CHAO ET AL: ""Quantum error correction with only two extra qubits"", ARXIV.ORG, CORNELL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, 201 OLIN LIBRARY CORNELL UNIVERSITY ITHACA, NY 14853, 5 May 2017 (2017-05-05), XP081276262, DOI: 10.1103/PHYSREVLETT.121.050502;;RUI CHAO ET AL: ""Fault-tolerant quantum computation with few qubits"", ARXIV.ORG, CORNELL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, 201 OLIN LIBRARY CORNELL UNIVERSITY ITHACA, NY 14853, 15 May 2017 (2017-05-15), XP081399504, DOI: 10.1038/S41534-018-0085-Z;;CHRISTOPHER CHAMBERLAND ET AL: ""Very low overhead fault-tolerant magic state preparation using redundant ancilla encoding and flag qubits"", ARXIV.ORG, CORNELL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, 201 OLIN LIBRARY CORNELL UNIVERSITY ITHACA, NY 14853, 6 March 2020 (2020-03-06), XP081616031;;SELF CHRIS N ET AL: ""Protecting Expressive Circuits with a Quantum Error Detection Code"", ARXIV (CORNELL UNIVERSITY), 12 November 2022 (2022-11-12), Ithaca, XP093125512, Retrieved from the Internet <URL:https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.06703.pdf> [retrieved on 20240130], DOI: 10.48550/arxiv.2211.06703;;R.
